## Description
Support your face-to-face writing communication: reflect your message so the person in front of you can read it immediately.

When you want to quickly communicate with someone in front of you by writing but donâ€™t have a sheet of paper and a pencil, you can type and show your message right away.

- Write your message in the bottom half of the screen.
- Clear the message by tapping the "X" button.
- You can hide the keyboard when finished writing.
- Share your text message by tapping the Action button. 
- Change the font size, weight, and design in Settings.

### Single Mode
You can hide the reflected text by enabling the single mode. For example, this mode is suitable when you want to show the message to the person next to you and communicate with him/her side by side.
